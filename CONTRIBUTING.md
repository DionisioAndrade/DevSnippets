First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!  
This repository is intended to be a **collaborative, educational, and practical** collection of code examples and snippets.

## üìå Contribution Rules

Please follow these rules to maintain the quality and consistency of the project:

### ‚úÖ 1. Code Documentation

- At the top of **every file**, include a comment or docstring that explains:
  - What the code does
  - What language or technology it uses
  - The author‚Äôs name (you!)
  - The date (optional but recommended)

**Example:**

```python
"""
title: Convert Dictionary to JSON
description: Converts a Python dictionary into a JSON-formatted string and writes it to a file.
author: Jo√£o Silva
date: 2025-05-22
"""
```

 ### ‚úÖ2. Inline Comments
- Explain important logic within the code using inline comments.

  - This helps beginners understand how and why something works.

```python
# Create a dictionary with sample data
data = {"name": "Ana", "age": 25}
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Language Folder
- Add your code to the correct folder:

  - e.g., python/snippets/, javascript/projects/, etc.

- If the folder does not exist, feel free to create it!

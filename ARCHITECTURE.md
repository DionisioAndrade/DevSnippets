## 📝 Commenting Guidelines

### 🔹 Single-Line Comments

Use single-line comments if your language doesn’t support block comments.

---

## 💬 Inline Comments

- Use **meaningful, clear comments** to explain how the code works.
- Especially required for:
  - loops
  - conditional statements
  - non-obvious or complex logic

**Example (Python):**
```python
# Loop through each item in the list and print it
for item in items:
    print(item)
```

- ✅ convert_to_json.py
- ✅ string_utils.js
- ❌ ConvertToJson.py
- ❌ stringUtils.js

## ✍️ Signature
